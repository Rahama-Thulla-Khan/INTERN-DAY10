🚀 Internship Day 10 - JavaScript Variables & Conditional Statements

📅 Date: [07/02/2025]

🏢 Internship at: [TOP TECH DEVELOPER]

📌 What I Did Today:

1️⃣ Created JavaScript Variables

Declared variables using let, const, and var.

Assigned values and explored different data types.

2️⃣ Implemented Conditional Statements

Used if statements to check conditions.

Printed true or false in HTML based on conditions.

Practiced using comparison operators for logical evaluations.

🔍 Key Takeaways:

✅ Variables store data and can be manipulated dynamically.✅ If statements help in decision-making based on conditions.✅ Connecting JavaScript with HTML enhances interactivity.

Looking forward to more hands-on JavaScript coding! 🚀🔥
